        <h1>Information about me</h1>
        <body>
        <p>I was born in Bellevue, Washington, and am the middle child, with one older brother and one younger sister. I am an accounting major in the Foster School of Business, and am planning on working specifically in audit at a public accounting firm. I weirdly like accounting; the combination of crumching numbers and problem solving is right up my alley. Although I enjoy numbers, I am not particularly skilled in computers; hence why this page is probably ugly. Having been born and raised in Washington (and 15 minutes outside of Seattle) I really want to move out of state after graduation, maybe to Arizona or California. </p>
